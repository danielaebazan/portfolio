                <p>Before diving into software engineering, I earned a degree in industrial engineering. This background has given me a
                unique perspective and a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through workouts and various physical activities. I also love painting, cooking,
                and spending quality time in creative pursuits.</p>
